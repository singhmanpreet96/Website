				<p class = "about">Hi, my name is Manpreet Singh. Most people call me Manny.
				<br>
				I am currently a Junior at San Jose State University pursuing a Software Engineering major.
				<br>
				<u>Experienced in:</u> HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Java, and Swift
				<br>
				I created this website from scratch to host my projects and showcase my talents.
				<br>
				In my free time I enjoy videogames, taking photos, and admiring cars.
				<br>
				My friends would describe me as curious, motivated, and responsible.
				<br>
				I am actively seeking an internship, and my resume will be available upon request.

				<h1 class = "postHeading">Programming</h1>
				<p class = "postText">
					All throughout highschool, I really didn't know the career path I wanted to go down. I was scared, didn't know what was right or wrong. Everyone had their opinions, and I just didn't know. I took numerous science classes, with the possibility of heading into the medical field. Then finally, junior year came around. A new class was being offered, AP Computer Science. I thought, "Why not? Wouldn't hurt." That was one of the best decisions of my life. I enjoyed the thrill of solving programs, the struggles of finding a solution, and harnessing the power of technology.
				</p>
				<h1 class = "postHeading">Videogames</h1>
				<p class = "postText">
					Video games have been in my life since I was a child. They have always lifted my spirits and helped my creative juices flow. I love playing competitive video games such as League of Legends, Fornite, and Battlegrounds. I also enjoy single player games such as the Far Cry series and Dark Souls.
				</p>

				<h1 class = "postHeading">Photography</h1>
				<p class = "postText">
					Photography is one of my newest hobbies, and I am glad to have found it. I enjoy being creative, and photography is a great method of letting that creativity flow. Although I am fairly new, I enjoy messing around with different angles, aperatures, and shutter speeds. I would love to start taking some more low light shots.
				</p>

				<h1 class = "postHeading">Cars</h1>
				<p class= "postText">
					Cars, to most people they are simply a means of getting from point A to point B. In my case, its different. I enjoy admiring the sounds the engine and exhausts make. I drool over the sight of a properly built car. Most of all, I admire those who go out and track their vehicles. There is so much precision involved in driving at fast speeds, and I admire those who do it flawlessly. Something about seeing an Aventador whizz by just gives me the chills.
